# Body Tracking with Depth Sensor Cameras course

**This repository contains the files for the course I gave at the University of MÃ¼nster in SOSE 2021.**

"_Body tracking in closed spaces with depth sensor cameras_".

In this course, we will use three different depth cameras. After the theoretical background, the exercises will give more insights into the data available and the code manipulation for accessing it.

## Installation intructions
To find the installation process for your device, go to this repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/violetasdev/bodytrackingdepth_course/wiki) and find your device! You will find a page for each depth camera available with the following content:

* Requirements
* Install instructions
* Testing configuration
* Useful links

## Exercises
You will find the __docs__ folder with the tutorials per device in the repository.

1. [Kinect V2 Tutorials Updated to (2021)](https://github.com/violetasdev/bodytrackingdepth_course/tree/master/KinectV2/docs)

## Course topics
1. Introduction to the course
2. Tracking technologies and techniques
3. Depth sensor technologies. Concepts and techniques
4. Identifying human body cues with depth cameras
5. Depth cameras hardware overview
6. Depth cameras models
 
Slides links will be available soon!

## Disclaimer:
The tutorials are based on the dynamics from [Kinect V02 Tutorial (2015)](http://kinect.github.io/tutorial/), but the code has been updated to work for Windows 10 applications using the __Windows.Kinect__ library as in the __Kinect V2 SDK Samples__. We hope this is helpful for other developers using KinectV2 in 2021!
